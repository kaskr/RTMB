\title{RTMB: R bindings for 'TMB'}
\description{
The package 'RTMB' provides a native R interface for \emph{a subset of}
'TMB' so you can avoid coding in C++.  'RTMB' only affects the
'TMB' function 'MakeADFun' that builds the objective function. Once
'MakeADFun' has been invoked, everything else is \emph{exactly the same}
and \emph{models run as fast} as if coded in C++.
}
\details{
'RTMB' offers a greatly simplified interface to 'TMB'. The TMB objective function can now be written entirely in R rather than C++ (\link{TMB-interface}). In addition, we highlight two new simplifications:
\enumerate{
\item For the most cases, simulation testing can be carried out \emph{automatically} without the need to add simulation blocks (\link{Simulation}).
\item Also, quantile residuals can be obtained without any essential modifications to the objective function (\link{OSA-residuals}).
}

The introduction vignette describes these basic features - see \code{vignette("RTMB-introduction")}.

In addition to the usual \link{MakeADFun} interface, 'RTMB' offers a lower level interface to the AD machinery (\code{MakeTape}). \link{MakeTape} replaces the functionality you would normally get in 'TMB' using C++ functors, such as calculating derivatives inside the objective function.

The advanced vignette covers these topics - see \code{vignette("RTMB-advanced")}.
}
\note{
'RTMB' relies heavily on the new AD framework 'TMBad' without which this interface would not be possible.
